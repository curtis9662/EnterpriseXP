With over 17 years of experience in IAM, Network Engineering & Cybersecurity, I possess a deep understanding of security compliance frameworks, best practices, and technologies, coupled with a proven track record of designing, implementing, and managing secure cloud / hybrid Enterprise environments. Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated a strong ability to protect organizations from ever evolving cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. 
My expertise in cloud security architecture, identity and access management (IAM), vulnerability management, blue/red/purple team ops, admin.microsoft.com / console.aws.amazon.com engineering, and GRC assessment/attestations; has enabled me to categorize and safeguard critical data, systems, and applications, drastically reducing our threat landscape for a range of clients across various industries. In my previous information security roles at IMPLUS, Apptio, CPS & Gallagher, I spearheaded the migration of 20 brands & 1,400+ sites & API endpoints during M&A projects, ensuring seamless integration and adherence to stringent security standards, utilizing AWS/AZURE (Cloud Watch, Cloud Trail, GuardDuty, CodeGuru, Defender, Sentinel, Portal, Compliance, & AZ cli) zapproxy, burp, zenmap, nmap, ide’s & browser devtools. This project involved managing over 7,000 internal users, 12,000 devices, and a vast amount of business data. 
I meticulously prioritized data sources, identified assets and risks, designed a target security architecture, developed threat models, pioneered the shift left project approach and developed a comprehensive migration plan. My responsibilities extended to implementing the security and IAM migration plan, continuously monitoring and testing the migrated environment, reporting security posture to the CIO/CEO and updating security policies and procedures to align with the new Azure architecture. 
Additionally, I developed security documentation and portals for employee education and training, and collaborated with third-party vendors to ensure compliance with security standards across all Azure, AWS, GCP-connected assets.. Beyond my technical expertise, I bring strong communication and collaboration skills to the organization.
 I am adept at translating complex technical concepts into clear and concise language, fostering effective communication with non-technical stakeholders and gaining trust for business systems and security initiatives. My unwavering commitment to due diligence has been instrumental in ensuring that potential acquisitions adhere to the highest security standards. I have a proven track record of documenting baseline security controls, policies, and procedures, as well as identifying and addressing known and outstanding security vulnerabilities. 
I am confident that my extensive experience, deep understanding of network and cloud security principles, and proven ability to deliver secure solutions align perfectly with this role. I am eager to contribute my expertise to your team and help achieve your clients Business objectives and align IAM/PAM Information Technology with our Cybersecurity Architecture, Framework Compliance Attestation, FedRAMP & GRC goals. 
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further and demonstrating how I can add value to your organization's stakeholders and clients.
