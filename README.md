_“Secure the architecture, enable the business.”_

<h1>Curtis Jones</h1>

<h2>Professional Statement</h2>
<p>
With approximately 18 years of experience spanning Identity and Access Management (IAM), Network Archtiecture/Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Scalability Forecasting; I've cultivated an in-depth understanding of enterprise security architectures, compliance frameworks, and the operational challenges of securing hybrid and cloud-native environments. My expertise integrates both strategic planning and hands-on engineering, with a focus on aligning cybersecurity capabilities to organizational risk tolerance (analysis), business objectives, and regulatory mandates.
</p>

<p>
Over the course of my career—serving Public and Privatized clients and employers such as DoD, IMPLUS, Humana, IBM dba (Apptio), OptumRx dba (CPS), and Gallagher —I have led security integration efforts during M&A activities that encompassed over 1,400 sites, 20 brands, and thousands of endpoints and APIs. These migrations were executed within securely governed environments using Azure, AWS,and GCP cloud services (e.g., CloudWatch, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Azure Defender, Sentinel, AZ CLI), as well as open-source tools including ZAP Proxy, Burp Suite, and Nmap. In doing so, I directly managed the protection of more than 71,000 users and 12,000 endpoints across diverse business units.
</p>

<p>
Beyond implementation, I have played a central role in defining and executing enterprise-level IAM/PAM, CI/CD, IAC, DevOps, and Application Security roadmaps, driving strategic alignment between security architecture and business risk posture. My methodology integrates asset prioritization, risk identification, threat modeling, and architecture design, all underpinned by robust governance and continuous monitoring. I have reported directly to C-level leadership, built internal portals for employee training and documentation, and led vendor collaborations to ensure third-party compliance across all assets connected to AWS, Azure, and GCP.
</p>

<p>
I also bring a commitment to communication and organizational change management. I specialize in translating complex technical concepts into business-aligned action items, enabling stakeholders to engage with cybersecurity initiatives that protect and promote their enterprise goals without disturbing business relationships or work flows. My contributions have supported successful GRC audits, security policy refinement, and executive-level cybersecurity attestation
